## About

 - Listening comprehension is utilized to understand the clues and solve the word.
 - Vocabulary is increased by using new words creatively, which helps cement them in long-term memory.

## How to Play

In essence, a round is one person getting the other player(s) to say a specific word. A game can consist of any number of rounds. Players may wish to take turns giving clues each round or switch roles after a certain number of rounds. <br>

One round is played like this:

1. One player will see a card with a word in their target language at the top. Below the target word will be 0-5 words related to the target word. No one else is allowed to look at this card.
   - If you don't know a word on the card, you can click the word to see a pop-up definition. 
2. The clue-giver must speak in the target language to get the other player(s) to figure out the word. 
   - This can be done by describing the meaning of the word, or providing synonyms, or telling stories where the word might fit. 
   - The clue giver is not allowed to say the target word or any of the related words in any form.
3. Once the other player(s) figure out the word and say it out loud, you score the word.

The game settings can be used to select the target language and to adjust the difficulty appropriately. 
 - The target words can be limited based on how common they are by choosing the common, uncommon, and/or rare word sets.
 - The number of related words can be increased to have more restrictions or decreased to have fewer restrictions. 
 - A time limit can be specified for each round, so the word must be scored within that limit or else the point is lost.

Word freqeuncy data for all languages comes from [wordfreq](https://zenodo.org/record/7199437), a very useful tool that I used to obtain the frequency score of a word and a list of the most common words in a specified language.
