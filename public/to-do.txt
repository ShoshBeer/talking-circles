Fix bug:
-cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map') error thrown pretty frequently when choosing a new random word. Has happened for sure with 'yeah', 'inform', and I think 'else' and maybe 'glitter' or something.

Related words:
-filter related words to same difficulty or easier as target word
-change the list generator to get better related words (maybe collect trigger words and synonyms and then sort by score or frequency)

Target words:
-add field to input target word manually
-add way to upload list of vocabulary words to select target words from
-make sure there are 10 related words?
-filter duplicate words on list with different forms (e.g. answer and answers, economize and economise)
-make only one accordion tab open at a time

General:
-add language selector
-add support for Spanish (to start)
-add control to disable definitions
-users can indicate if they were successful for a given word and the card (or score) gets saved for viewing later (with react router?)
-option to display timer that logs the time the card was displayed
-set maximum time for card before it's added to miss and new word is rolled
-minimize help by default on widths < 992px (md and smaller)

Done:
-add instructions
-filter related words to remove words containing target word (e.g. 'daughter' has related word 'granddaughter')
-add click or hover over definitions for target word and related words 
-add control for number of related words
-make popover definition for target word responsive (changed to bottom position)
